This app was developed as part of my end-of-term project. It is designed to provide dog owners with valuable information and tools to better care for their pets.  

## Features  
- **Meaningful Locations**  
  Discover and manage locations relevant to your dogâ€™s needs.  

- **Exercise Dashboard**  
  Track physical, mental, and chewing exercises to ensure a balanced routine.  

- **Chatbot Assistance**  
  A smart chatbot that answers common questions about your dog. It personalizes responses based on the dog's information provided during login.  

## Additional Details  

In addition to these features, we implemented a complete user authentication system with login and signup functionality.  

This project was a collaborative effort, and while I don't have permission to share the code, the development process was carried out using WebStorm and various APIs.
